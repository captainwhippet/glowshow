========

Controlling the PiGlow remotely via a simple socket server.

These simple scripts help you get a server running on the RaspberryPi. You can send commands to it from another device (e.g. PC or iPhone/iPad using Pythonista) and set patterns, the speed of change and brightness.

This is version 0.1, so a bit basic, but more will follow!
